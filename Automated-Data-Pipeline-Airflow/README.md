OpenWeather Data Pipeline using Airflow and AWS S3

#Overview
This project is designed to collect weather data from a weather API and store it in an AWS S3 bucket in CSV format. The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow, ensuring automated and timely data collection and storage.

Weather Data Pipeline Image

Features
1. Data Collection
The pipeline fetches weather data from a weather API.
It supports dynamic configuration to collect data for different locations and parameters.
2. Data Transformation
Collected data is transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis.
Temperature values are converted from Kelvin to Celsius for easier interpretation.
3. Data Storage
Transformed data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket in CSV format.
The pipeline handles naming and organizing files based on timestamps.
4. Scheduling
The data collection process is scheduled at regular intervals using Apache Airflow's scheduling capabilities.
You can easily customize the schedule to meet your specific needs.
5. Error Handling
Robust error-handling mechanisms are in place to ensure data integrity and reliability.
Airflow's logging and alerting features help in identifying and resolving issues.
Technologies Used
Apache Airflow: Orchestrating the data pipeline and scheduling tasks.
Python 3: Writing custom data collection and transformation scripts.
Pandas: Data manipulation and transformation.
Boto3: Interacting with AWS S3 for data storage.
Weather API: Fetching weather data (replace with the name of the specific weather API you use).
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Weather-Data-Pipeline.git
Install the required packages.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a config.py file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

python
Copy code
WeatherAPIKey = "[Your Weather API Key]"
AWSAccessKey = "[Your AWS Access Key]"
AWSSecretKey = "[Your AWS Secret Key]"
S3BucketName = "[Your S3 Bucket Name]"
Update the airflow.cfg file to point to your config.py file and set the appropriate S3 bucket name.

Start the Airflow webserver.

bash
Copy code
airflow webserver
Access Airflow through your browser using the default 8080 port.

In the Airflow UI, enable the weather_data_pipeline DAG.

The pipeline will run on the schedule defined in the DAG and store the weather data in the specified S3 bucket in CSV format.

Customization
You can customize the data collection parameters by modifying the data collection script.
Adjust the schedule_interval in the DAG definition to change the frequency of data collection.
Error Handling and Troubleshooting
Airflow provides a UI for monitoring the status of tasks and DAG runs.
In case of task failure, the UI displays the error message and traceback for troubleshooting.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build an automated data pipeline using Apache Airflow to collect weather data from a weather API and store it in an AWS S3 bucket. Following the steps outlined in this README, you can set up and run the pipeline to automate weather data collection and storage.

Note: Always ensure compliance with the terms of service of the weather API provider and any relevant data privacy and security regulations before using the data in production.

Future Enhancements
This project lays the foundation for further enhancements, such as data analysis, visualization, and integration with other data sources. Future improvements can make this pipeline even more powerful for data-driven decision-making.
